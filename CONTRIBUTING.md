# Contributing to re-frame-document-fx

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Support questions

The Github issues are for bug reports and feature requests only. Support requests and usage
questions should go to the re-frame [Clojure Slack channel](http://clojurians.net) or
the [ClojureScript mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurescript).


## Pull requests

**Create pull requests to the develop branch**, work will be merged onto master when it is ready to be released.

## Running tests

#### Via Browser/HTML

To build the tests and run them in one step, just:
```sh
lein test-once  # compiles & then opens test.html in the browser
```

You can also get auto compiles via:
```sh
lein test-auto
```
but you'll need to manually open `test/test.html` in a browser. And you'll also need to
manually reload this page after each auto compile.

#### Via Karma

To run the tests, you must have recent versions of node, npm, Leiningen, and a C++ compiler toolchain installed.
If you're on Linux or Mac OS X then you will be fine, if you're on Windows then you need to install
Visual Studio Community Edition, and the C++ compiler dependencies.

```sh
lein deps       # runs lein-npm, installs Karma & other node dependencies. Only needed the first time.
lein karma-once # to build re-frame-http-fx tests
karma start     # to run the tests with an auto watcher
```
